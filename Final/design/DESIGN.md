# Sneaksy and the Quest for the Jakkenstone

## Gameplay
### Input
1. Sneaksy launches a powerful Storm of Armadyllo attack. It creates a ball that bounces against enemies and obstacles.
2. Sneaksy is very agile and always follows the Storm of Armadyllo. If you swipe, he will hit the ball in that direction (assuming it's within range). If you miss, you heal a little bit (depending on how strong the Storm of Armadyllo is), but the Storm of Armadyllo weakens.
3. When an enemy dies, Sneaksy can resurrect it as a wight by tapping it. (All dead enemies within range are resurrected).
4. Sneaksy can teleport from one side of the arena to the other by swiping across with a long gesture (left to right)

### Mechanics
* Sneaksy can resurrect fallen enemies as wights. If they die again, they fade away. Wights attack nearby enemies.
* The Storm of Armadyllo damages enemies. The more times it has hit the Jakkenstone, the more damage it deals.
* The Jakkenstone is in the middle of the arena.
* Enemies can attack Sneaksy. By swiping, Sneaksy can kill them instantly (assuming they're nearby); otherwise, you must use the Storm of Armadyllo.

1. Enemies come in waves.
2. Every so many waves a mini-boss spawns.
3. At the end, a Drakkenson spawns, as the final boss.
