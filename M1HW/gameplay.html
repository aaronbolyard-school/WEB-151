				<p>The objective of the game is to find and murder some victims. There's two stages:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Kill all victims on the map.</li>
					<li>Kill the final victim who appears on an "X", with a quick-time event (QTE).</li>
				</ol>

				<p>It's not as easy as it sounds. Jason (the player character) moves in the direction you swipe until he hits an obstacle. There's traps (fire, water) where he instantly dies. Sometimes there's traps where Jason will get endlessly stuck moving between two positions.</p>

				<p>The victims have gimmicks, too. In the first episode, they ocasionally run away from Jason when they spot him. This can be used to kill them (they, too, die if they run into a trap) as well.</p>

				<p>Upon killing all victims in the map, a final victim spawns on a "X" mark. When Jason reaches this victim, a QTE event occurs where you have to time a tap to reach a "sweet spot". If you fail, the victim gets away.</p>

				<p>Cosmetic changes, such as skins and weapons, allow customizing the experience, but offer no gameplay benefits. Weapons also change the kill scenes at the end of a level.</p>
