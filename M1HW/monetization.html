				<p>The game has two means of monetization: cosmetics (weapons and outfits [skins] for Jason) and additional episodes.</p>

				<p>The additional content is rather affordable:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>$1.99 for a skin and an episode (collection of levels). For example, buying <i>Mama's Megamart</i> unlocks Zombie Jason.</li>
					<li>$9.99 for all episodes and skins.</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="description">There's a "Pay To Unlock" button. Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/976481">Marshall Walker</a>.</p>

				<p>Most content can be unlocked during gameplay.</p>

				<p>During a 15 minute gameplay session (completing Episode 1, <i>Crystal Lake Memories</i>), the only time in-app purchase notifications appear is when viewing content not yet unlocked or hidden behind a purchase. There was also a mention when Jason went up a rank, which occurs every 4-5 levels.</p>

				<p>The monetization strategy is well implemented and unobtrusive for the player, gaining notable mentions from sites like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-13-friday-the-13th-killer-puzzle-review-a-surprisingly-cute-horror-show">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
